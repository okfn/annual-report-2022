We are once again prioritising our international network, which is now present
and active in dozens of countries. We have reorganised our tools and services
to continue offering cutting-edge technology aimed at open access to data,
science, government information, and content in general. We deepened our
collaboration with communities around the world, seeking to promote more
conversations in Global South countries. We reviewed our position as open
advocates to face the most pressing problems of our times, such as climate
change and the various crises of modern democracy.
<p class=pt-10>
And we will continue to do all of that in 2023!

This year we have focused on <span class=font-bold>restructuring and reimagining our Open Knowledge
Network</span>. At the beginning of the year we had several brainstorming sessions
with Network members to understand together in what direction we wanted the
Network to move forward, which culminated in a face-to-face meeting in
Barcelona at the beginning of May.
<p class=pt-10>
On November 28th we <a target=_blank href=https://blog.okfn.org/2022/11/28/better-together-than-alone-open-knowledge-network/>relaunched the Open Knowledge Network</a> with two new
projects: the <a target=_blank href=https://network.okfn.org/project>Project Repository</a>, a database of the most prominent projects
from the Open Knowledge Network and allies in the open movement, and the <a target=_blank href=https://network.okfn.org/specialist>Global
Directory</a>, a highly curated and searchable database of specialists in different
areas of the open movement.

<p class=pt-10>
We entered 2022
with enthusiasm for finding ways to work together on the many challenges we
face today, starting with climate data, so we gathered with climate researchers,
activists and organisations to brainstorm ways to collaborate and use the
Frictionless Data tooling to make open climate data more usable, accessible,
and impactful (read about it <a target=_blank href=https://blog.okfn.org/2022/03/09/combining-data-skills-knowledge-and-networks-to-save-our-planet/>here</a>). This work was well-received and there is a
lot of enthusiasm from potential collaborators and funders in this area.
<p class=pt-10>
<h4 class=font-bold>Software</h4>
<br>
We have released <a target=_blank href=https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/>Frictionless Framework (v5)</a>, a data management
framework for Python that provides functionality to describe, extract,
validate, and transform tabular data. It’s the second public version of this software, incorporating functional and performance improvements based on user feedback. It now also includes a CKAN, GitHub, and Zenodo integration. These features were highly sought after by the community.
<p class=pt-10>
We have also released <a target=_blank href=https://repository.frictionlessdata.io/>Frictionless Repository (v2)</a>, a data management service
that brings continuous data validation to tabular data in your repository via
Github Action. This service is based on the Frictionless Framework and now supports
all the new features of the framework.
<p class=pt-10>
We continued research on <a target=_blank href=https://livemark.frictionlessdata.io/>Livemark (v1)</a>, a data presentation framework for
Python that generates static sites from extended Markdown with interactive
charts, tables, scripts, and other features. In 2022 we didn’t have this work
prioritised but we’re going to continue development in 2023 as this project is
very promising and we have already been able to migrate all our documentation
portals to Livemark.
<p class=pt-10>
We started working on <a target=_blank href=https://application.frictionlessdata.io/>Frictionless Application (MVP)</a>, a data management
application for Browser and Desktop that provides functionality to describe,
extract, validate, and transform tabular data with a UI. This project is a
logical continuation of the Frictionless Data project's standards and software
with a focus on the non-technical audience: data publishers, librarians, and,
in general, people who prefer visual interfaces over command-line interfaces
and programming languages. We’re targeting Q1 of 2023 for a first public
release.
<p class=pt-10>
We were again focused on <a target=_blank href=https://frictionlessdata.io/adoption/>Frictionless Adoption</a> work and we participated in the
development of valuable CKAN extensions based on Frictionless Software:
ckanext-validation, providing an ability to validate uploaded tabular
resources, and ckanext-datapackager, providing an ability to export a dataset
as a Frictionless Data Package.
<p class=pt-10>
We continued enriching <a target=_blank href=https://frictionlessdata.io/people/>Frictionless Team</a> and contributors community. Since
April 2022, a new developer, Shashi Gharti, has joined the Frictionless Data
core team. Shashi has worked on the GitHub and Zenodo integrations for the
Frictionless Framework and has also presented her work at two community calls
already (in <a target=_blank href=https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2022/08/30/community-call-github-integration/>August</a> and in <a target=_blank href=https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2022/11/02/october-call/>October</a>). In November and December 2022, an OKFN’s
intern Polina Ganina participated in the Frictionless Application work. During
the year we received a great deal of contributions from our community – we want
to say thanks again to everyone who participated in the work!
<p class=pt-10>
<h4 class=font-bold>Fellows</h4>
<br>
The 3rd cohort of Frictionless Fellows, mentored by Lilly Winfree, officially
ended their fellowship in July 2022. Melvin Adhiambo Ochieng, Guo-Qiang Zhang,
Victoria Stanley, Kevin Kidambasi Ogola, Lindsay Gypin, Zarena Syrgak have been
an amazing cohort. You can read about their experience in <a target=_blank href=https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2022/03/05/fellows-datapackage/>packaging data</a> and <a target=_blank href=https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2022/05/15/fellows-reproducing-datapackages/>in
reproducing someone else’s research data</a> (not such a frictionless experience as
some may think!).
<p class=pt-10>
At the end of their fellowship, they shared their thoughts and what the
fellowship meant to them in the form of blog posts. We encourage you to read
them all, because they are really insightful and moving:

The Frictionless Data community keeps growing, with new champions emerging and
bringing new ideas and interactions. Some examples of this:
<p class=pt-10>
<ul class="list-disc pl-10 pt-5">
<li>A community member, Peter Desmet, has worked on a <a href=https://github.com/frictionlessdata/frictionless-r target=_blank>Frictionless R library</a>, to
read and write Data Packages. </li>
<li>Mister Open Data published his thoughts about
Frictionless in <a href=https://open-north.de/blog/2022-08-04_frictionless/ target=_blank>a blogpost</a> and a follow-up blog (available in <a href=https://open-north.de/blog/2022-11-21_frictionless_my_open_issues/ target=_blank>English</a> and
<a href=https://open-north.de/blog/2022-11-21_frictionless_meine_punkte/ target=_blank>German</a>) on his open issues with Frictionless.</li>
</ul>
<p class=pt-10>
To better showcase community contributions, we have updated the website and
created a <a href=https://frictionlessdata.io/universe/ target=_blank>“Frictionless Universe” page</a>.
<p class=pt-10>
We have also published 4 new case-studies this year

<p class=pt-10>
As the Discord community chat was becoming less and less practical, at the
beginning of the year we decided to move it <a target=_blank href=https://join.slack.com/t/frictionlessdata/shared_invite/zt-17kpbffnm-tRfDW_wJgOw8tJVLvZTrBg>to Slack</a> (with <a target=_blank href=https://matrix.to/#/#frictionlessdata:matrix.okfn.org>a Matrix bridge</a> for
those wishing to use an open source equivalent), which allows us to keep track
of the conversations and open issues in a much clearer way. We observed that it
also led to a clear increase in community interaction.

<b class=font-bold>Transparency International</b>
<p class=pt-2>
For the third time since 2017, OKF
has partnered with Transparency International (TI) to support their
chapters in building their data literacy and advise them on data
project delivery. This time the support was provided in the context
of the <a target=_blank href=https://www.transparency.org/en/projects/strengthening-accountability-networks-among-civil-society-sancus>SANCUS project</a> which aims to advance democratic
accountability worldwide. As part of this project, we designed and
delivered a <a target=_blank href=https://school-of-data.github.io/okf-events-a/data-literacy/2022/10/data-collection-ti-01>‘Data Collection for Civic Projects’ training</a>, aiming
to provide TI chapters with key knowledge and methods to tackle the
various data collection tasks that civic projects inevitably face,
whether on the field or as part of desk research.
<p class=pt-10>
<b class=font-bold>United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR)</b>
<p class=pt-2>
This year we continued our alliance with the United Nations by
further developing and enhancing the RIDL application for the UN
Refugees Agency. RIDL (Raw Internal Data Library) is the platform
UNHCR uses to centralise and secure all refugee and operational
data used by their staff. This repository built on CKAN ensures
their team is able to share and document sensitive data
comprehensively, as well as make it available externally for
operational partners.

In 2022, OKF was involved in the development of the <a target=_blank href=https://www.unesco.org/en/digital-competency-framework>Digital
Transformation and AI Competency Framework for Civil Servants report</a>
as part of a multi stakeholder group working with the <a target=_blank href=https://broadbandcommission.org/ai-capacity-building/https://broadbandcommission.org/ai-capacity-building/>UNESCO
Broadband Commission Working Group on AI Capacity Building</a>. The
commission conducted a series of consultations on the global level in
order to assess the critical capacity needs for public sector digital
transformation. Alongside CEO Renata Avila, both Carolina Matos,
based in Brazil, and Ben Hur Pintor, based in the Philippines,
participated in expert global and regional consultation sessions and
also provided written inputs to the draft.
<p class=pt-10>
The challenge was to strengthen capacities of government officials to
leverage digital technologies, especially from a developing country
perspective, and to respond to the socio-economic and human rights
challenges engendered by their use. The digital era governance
requires a new set of skills and competencies from civil servants to
ensure that digital transformation and regulatory initiatives are in
line with a human Rights, Openness, inclusive Access and
Multistakeholder participation and gender equality-based (ROAM-X)
approach. The output was the development of a set of nine
recommendations in three competency domains that are
context-sensitive and adaptable for use to support capacity building
for civil services across ICT Ministries and Digital Units in

CoAct
</div>
</div>
<div>
After 3 years of activity, the CoAct project entered its final year.
During this period OKF supported the three civic organisations
selected as part of the <a target=_blank href=https://coactproject.eu/gender-equality/>Gender Equality Open Calls</a> in order for them
to adapt the Citizen Social Science methods to their work. This
stream of work concluded with the publication of a <a target=_blank href=https://zenodo.org/record/7253650>white paper on
Citizen Science applied to Civic Organisation Projects</a> which outlined
the insights gained from the Open Calls as well as recommendations
for decision-makers.
<p class=pt-10>
We also supported the organising of the CoAct online conference which
took place in October, and where the results of the consortium’s work
were presented.
<p class=pt-10>
Lastly, as the Consortium member tasked with overseeing the data
strategy of the CoAct project, OKF also published the final version
of the project’s Data Management Plan, which was our last CoAct
deliverable.

In 2022 OKF delivered 7 trainings for governments and civic
organisations (such as the Red Cross or Medecins Sans Frontières)
aimed at building their capacity in making use of geodata in their
operations. All of these trainings followed the <a target=_blank href=https://school-of-data.github.io/open-geodata-curriculum/en>open learning
content we published in 2021</a> and our 2-step training format,
combining 2 days of interactive learning sessions followed by 5

coordinated and communicated around the event, its open call and
<a target=_blank href=https://eiti.org/news/eiti-announces-winner-energy-transition-datathon>its results</a>. To ensure that this datathon avoided the pitfalls of

ensure that participants contributed ideas that would be relevant
to real problems faced by EITI stakeholders, increasing the chance
of the final prototypes being turned into real products or
processes.

In recent decades, Barcelona has been a benchmark for openness on
multiple levels, from immigration policies that welcome refugees, to
sophisticated citizen-driven processes to define data governance.
From resilient connectivity through groups and cooperatives to strict
rules to limit dominant digital platforms leading local alternatives
to flourish. It is also a historical place, where many of the global
initiatives to promote our global digital commons were launched, from
the <a target=_blank href=https://xnet-x.net/en/get-in-touch-for/the-oxcars/>oXcars</a> to the <a target=_blank href=https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/en/digital-transformation/city-data-commons>City Data Commons</a>.
<p class=pt-10>
The transversal generativity that open practices led Barcelona to
world leadership was the inspiration for the Open Knowledge
Foundation to choose the city as the setting for its first
post-pandemic meeting, in partnership with <a href=https://canodrom.barcelona/en/el-canodrom target=_blank>The Center for Digital and
Democratic Innovation / Open Canòdrom</a>, under the leadership of Arnaud
Monterde.
<p class=pt-10>
Collaborators from more than fifteen different nationalities and
backgrounds met to exchange with different digital communities and
validate a re-examined open agenda prepared to face the upcoming
challenges at a one-day Open Knowledge Symposium, which reflected the
past, present and future of our movement, with conversations ranging
from the early days of the open movement to cutting edge topics such
as decentralised finance, Web3 and dark DAOs. All staff and
representatives from the board and network attended the meeting,
committing to a joint agenda in the future.

ODD event in Tanzania
</span>
</div>
<div>
The twelfth <a href=https://opendataday.org/ target=_blank>Open Data Day</a> took place on Saturday, 5th March 2022 with
organisations across the world organising over <a target=_blank href=https://opendataday.org/events/2022/>153 registered events</a>
to celebrate, promote and spread the use of open data. Rather than
focusing on one particular day, OKF extended the period for the
execution of the grants beyond March and partnered with funders to
deliver a small grants program to support organisations hosting Open
Data events and activities across the world.
<p class=pt-10>
We supported 14 events; 10 open data events (with a grant of USD 750
each) and 4 events (with a grant of USD 1000 each) for the “Ocean
data for a thriving planet” category. Organisations from Madagascar,
Bolivia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ecuador, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Tanzania,
Brasil, Sweden, Argentina, Indonesia, and India were supported to
host events and activities. The detailed list of organisations that
receive small grants is <a target=_blank href=https://blog.okfn.org/2022/06/06/announcing-the-winners-of-the-open-data-day-2022-small-grants/>here</a>.
<p class=pt-10>
The small grants program was supported by Microsoft and Builder
Bridge. OKF also made the contribution to cover the coordination and
rethinking work of the project. The blog posts with detailed reports
of the events from the organisers are available on the <a target=_blank href=https://blog.okfn.org/category/open-data-day-2022/>OKF blog</a> and
the full report of the project can be accessed <a target=_blank href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OSvWII8tk9dwizZY9t4PtKiAlwaeWy7t_xq1zsRbkuU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

2022 saw an increased involvement from OKF in the maintenance and
development of the CKAN project. Our own Patricio del Boca became an
official member of the CKAN Tech Team, and several of OKF developers
are active contributors in both CKAN itself and some of its more
popular extensions.
<p class=pt-10>
OKF helped shape what will be the next major release of CKAN, 2.10,
contributing major features and managing incoming contributions. We
have also been actively involved in the process to define what <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14volOCJVav_Hp8BfFG3DYwBENoFX0k0RowtfdU8hNGY/edit#slide=id.g113d28fe904_0_32" target=_blank>CKAN
